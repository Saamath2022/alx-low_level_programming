# Space Complexity of Iterative Linear Search

The space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size \( n \) is \( O(1) \).

## Explanation

In an iterative linear search algorithm, the space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by the algorithm in addition to the input array. For a linear search, the algorithm only requires a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input array. This extra space is used for:

1. **Index Variable:** A single variable (e.g., `i`) to iterate through the array.
2. **Temporary Storage:** If needed, a temporary variable to store the element currently being checked.

Since these requirements do not grow with the size of the input array, the space complexity is \( O(1) \), meaning it uses a constant amount of space.
